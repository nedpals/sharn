# sharn (Work in progress)

A script built on Crystal that adds additional commands for the Shards package manager. It is inspired from [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), a package manager for Javascript.

With Sharn, you don't have to write dependencies directly to your `shard.yml` file. Instead, you just have to type in the command and you're ready to go.

**Note: This is not a replacement for Shards. Shards will still be used in installing your dependencies.**
